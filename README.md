# Portfolio-Analysis-and-Optimization
This project was part of the course work in Financial Engineering and Econometrics and hence we worked on stock market related data. The goal was to analyze and optimize the performance of a portfolio of stocks. As part of the project, we evaluated time series, correlation plots and developed efficient frontier analysis of a portfolio.
